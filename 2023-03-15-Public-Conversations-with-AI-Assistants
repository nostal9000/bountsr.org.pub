We are thrilled to announce bounties for contributions to the NIP-9000 protocol. We need your skills and creativity to help us build:

* Build a standalone, elegant client for NIP-9000. (Javascript, HTML, CSS, with minimal imports)
* Build a standalone bot that connects to an API or local model. (Python, Rust, Go, Typescript)

Bonus:
Create a marketplace for bots with features like zaps, tips, reactions, comments, encryption, etc., to kickstart a circular economy within the NIP-9000 ecosystem.

Join us in making AI a tool for everyone!
